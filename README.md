### Hi there 👋

I'm Aalaap Ghag. I like to build apps, design artwork and produce music. I also love to constantly learn new things and mentor teams and individuals. I live in Mumbai, India.

I love JavaScript and PHP, which comprises the bulk of my work, but I've also worked on C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET.

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on **modernizing legacy architectures of my own apps**
- 👨‍🏫 I’m currently learning **Rust**, **Go** and **Elixir**
- 👷‍♀️ I’m looking to collaborate on **React**, **Next.js**, **GatsbyJS** and **RedwoodJS**
- 🕵️‍♀️ I’m looking for help with **setting up CI/CD pipelines** and **enviroment management**
- 👨‍⚖️ Ask me about **NoSQL data modelling**, **atomic design methodology** and **functional programming**
- 👩‍✈️ How to reach me: `@gmail`
- 🧔 Pronouns: **he/him**
- 🧟‍♂️ Fun fact: **I always fly the airline of the country I'm flying to!**

Stay safe and keep coding!
