Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

<!-- GITHUBONLY START -->

This GitHub README is also rendered as my personal website
at [https://aalaap.com](https://aalaap.com). Check it out!

I'm Aalaap Ghag, a solutions architect and a full-stack software engineer from
Mumbai, India.

This is my personal website, where I endeavour to collect and list the things
I've worked on, things I've liked or just generally anything I've found
interesting. At some point, I might add an old-school blog too, but don't hold
your breath for that one!

So, look around and feel free to reach out for work and/or to chat about the
things I've listed here.

About
=====

My name is Aalaap Ghag and I'm a cloud solutions architect and a full-stack
JavaScript engineer from Mumbai, India.

I love all things JS: React, Next.js, Node.js, Bun, Deno, TypeScript. I also
enjoy working with serverless and edge cloud platforms like **Vercel**,
**Netlify**, as well as the usual suspects, **Amazon Web Services**, **Google
Cloud Platform** and **Microsoft Azure**.

I enjoy **app, server and service architecture**, **full-stack development**,
**NoSQL data modelling**, **workflow automation** and **productivity hacks**.

Previously, I've also worked on PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, C++, C#.NET and Visual
Basic and other technologies.

I love to constantly learn new things and teach others. If you work with any of
the tools mentioned above or similar ones, let's connect!

## This website

This website is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The UI kit used is
**DaisyUI**. It is hosted on **Vercel**.

All this content is being sourced from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/aalaap)
[README](https://github.com/aalaap/aalaap/blob/main/README.md), which is in
Markdown format. I've added some extra metadata to it in order to make it work
like a micro CMS, but it still looks normal when viewed on GitHub. On this
website, it is shown as separate pages. Adding one section to the README adds a
new page to the website without any extra work.

The metadata helps in ensuring that some content is only visible on the website
and not on GitHub, and vice versa. This section, for example, is only visible
on the website and not on GitHub.

You can see the source of the README [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aalaap/aalaap/refs/heads/main/README.md).

I could also use MDX to allow embedding React components in the markdown, but
it might not be able to be hidden on the GitHub profile view.

You might be wondering why I'm not just using separate markdown files for each
page, which won't be constrained by this README limitation. One reason is that
it saves me from having to update the README and then copy-paste the content to
the other file(s), but more interestingly, it's just fun to work with
arbitrary constraints like this.

Projects
========

_**TODO**: List some of the projects I've worked on here._

Work
====

I've worked as a technical/solutions architect, full-stack developer, pre-sales
architect and many others.

Prior to that, I used to be a tech journalist for
magazines like **Chip** and **Digit**, blogs like **Techtree** and **Tech 2.0**,
and I hosted/produced/wrote for a weekly tech show on **Bloomberg UTV**, which
was also called **Techtree**.

_**TODO**: Turn this into a mini-resume._

Blog
====

_**TODO**: Blog!_

Contact
=======

I am \`@aalaap\` on most social networks and other online platforms, but these
days I'm only (sporadically) active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aalaap).

You can also email me at Gmail, which allows me to be more verbose in the
conversation!

_**TODO**: Put a contact form here._

Thanks for stopping by!
